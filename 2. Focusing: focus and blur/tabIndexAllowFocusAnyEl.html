<!-- <div>, <span>, <table> – are unfocusable by default. The method elem.focus() doesn’t work on them, and focus/blur events are never triggered.

This can be changed using HTML-attribute tabindex.

Elements without matching tabindex are switched in the document source order (the default order).

There are two special values:

1. tabindex="0" puts an element among those without tabindex. That is, when we switch elements, elements with tabindex=0 go after elements with tabindex ≥ 1.

Usually it’s used to make an element focusable, but keep the default switching order. To make an element a part of the form on par with <input>.

2. tabindex="-1" allows only programmatic focusing on an element. The Tab key ignores such elements, but method elem.focus() works. 

NOTES: Can also use elem.tabIndex property. That has the same effect.

    that many subsequent Tabs can move the focus out of the iframe in the
    example.
